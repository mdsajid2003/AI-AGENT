# 🤖 AI Agent for Data Analysis using Groq AI

## 🧠 Overview
This project utilizes an AI agent powered by **Groq AI** to perform fast and efficient data analysis tasks on large datasets. The agent can:

- Clean and preprocess data
- Perform statistical analysis
- Visualize insights
- Generate summaries and reports
- Support natural language queries

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Groq AI LLM** – Ultra-fast language model inference
- **Python** – Main scripting language
- **Pandas / NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **gradio** (optional) – UI interface

## 🚀 Features

- Natural language querying of datasets (e.g., "Find the correlation between age and income")
- Automatic visualization based on user prompts
- On-demand report generation
- Seamless Groq LLM backend integration

## 📦 Installation
